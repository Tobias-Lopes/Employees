#Employees
This program will read an integer N and then the data (id, name and salary) of N employees. There must be no repetition of id.
Then, he will increase the salary of a specific employee by X percent.
To do this, the program will read an id and the value X. 
The program uses the encapsulation technique to prevent the salary from being changed freely. A salary can only be increased based on a given percentage increase operation.
